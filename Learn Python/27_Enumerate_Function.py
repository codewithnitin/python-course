# Above two approaches took one variable before loop and we incremented it as well so we have
# an alternative called enumerate function by which we can perform our task with ease.


# for index, item in enumerate(List):
#     if index%2==0:
#         print(f"Jarvis please buy {item}")

# Here we did not intialise variable outside loop and did not increment it so we saved our time.
# Here index value will start from zero automatically so we do not need to initialise as we did
# in above approach.
