Comparision between python 2.x and python 3.x ?

                                python2.x                                 python3.x

Division operator  :            3/2 = 1                                   3/2 = 1.5
                                3.0/2 = 1.5
                                3/2.0 = 1.5

It clears when we were dividing integer values in python2.x so we used to get output
1 which is floor value not decimal value after it so if we wanted to get the exact
real value so we used to keep one operand must be real number as we took in example
to get the exact real value number in output but that is not an issue in python3.x
so if we divide 3/2 which are integer values we get the required result which is 1.5


print method       :           print "Hello"                              print("Hello")
                               print("Hello")

We used to use print method or function in python2.x like that print "Hello" OR
print("Hello") but it is mandate to apply parenthesis in print method or print func.
in python3.x like this print("Hello") so if we type print "Hello" in python3.x so
will get an output as SyntaxError.


Range()            :           xrange()                                   range()

Whatever task was performing by xrange() method or function in python2.x that was
totally handled by function or method range() in python3.x it means xrange() is
no more exist in python3.x ( Matlab xrange() jo kaam krta that in pyhton2.x me
woh he kaam range() karta hai in python3.x me )


Exception handling  :         except Exception                            except Exception as e

As keyword is required in python3.x like this except Exception as e if we wish to
print the exact exception in except block otherwise we need to print manual one.
