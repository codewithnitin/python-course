Concept of Abstraction and Encapsulation in OOPS :

( It is not a big concept actually but very important to know when we are doing OOPS )

Abstraction : To hide the real implementation of anything from the user and provides knowing
only functionalities is known as Abstraction.

Real-life example :

1) Mouse : General user knows how to operate mouse like plug and play and after he/she will
get a cursor on moniter to click on anything to open up but they do not know how it is happening
actually ( What is the real mechanism behind mouse how it is working actually how they are
getting cursor on monitor and even they are not interested to know it actually just like
AAM KHAO GHUTLI MAT GINO general user ko matlab nahi ki mouse actually me work kaise kar raha
hai toh humne real mechanism ko hide kara general user se aur jitna jaruri hai uske use karne
ke liye woh bataya ye he hota hai Abstraction
)

Layer of Abstraction in Mouse : Chip, cable wire, button ab hume ye nahi pata ki inke banne
me kya mechanism use hua hai chip ke cable wire ke button ke toh ye he hai abstraction to
hide real mechanism from the user and provides knowing only functionalities


2 Computer : Here, Layer of Abstraction are Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, CPU, Motherboard, etc
General user gets the computer in assembled form and he knows to type keyboard is used, to move
cursor mouse is used, to display picture monitor is used but he does not know what is the
real mechanism of these items and even he/she is not interested to know it ye he Abstraction
hota hai

3. Suppose we are working in Mars Mission so there are several computers are used and each and
every computer handles different task or operation toh ye computers layer of Abstraction hai
as real user does not know the real mechanism of these computers which performs different -
different tasks

4. Suppose we are working on project which is game development in which one programmer gets
the task to build the player which runs, sit, look left and look right so that programmer
creates one class in which he made methods of player to run, look left and right & sit down
so he/she will create it and pass the code to second programmer and provides such details
like class variables or attributes, instance variables, methods, constructor, classmethod
static method so second programmer knows that is class player in which these are the methods,
constructor, classmethod, staticmethod so that second programmer can call methods easily
with the help of object and class in spite of knowing how the first programmer built these
methods, constructor, classmethod, staticmethod etc so here layer of abstraction are
class attributes, instance variables, constructor, clasmethod, staticmethod etc to second
programmer and second programmer will create another class city like our player will be moving
under city so designing of city by another class attributes or object attributes, methods ,
classmethods, staticmethod are layer of abstraction to rest of programmer and so on.



Encapsulation : Abstraction is achieved through Encapsulation

( Abstraction ka matlab real mechanism kisi bhi cheez ki user se chupana ab question ye hai
ki hum ye jo real mechanism ko chupa rahe hai user se kaise chupa pa rahe hai it is sure
there will be some securities or approaches behind it by which we are able to hide the real
mechanism from the user is known as Encapsulation.

Perfect definition of Encapsulation : An approach or security or protection or technique
which we are using to hide the real mechanism from the user end is known as Encapsulation.
